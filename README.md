# Chat Application
A chat application written in Java with cool features! This app is made for second semester's final project.

## Features
* Text styling
* Git changes notification
* Server password protection
* Code discussion features

## How to run
### Client
To run the app as client, just open the jar file by double clicking it on your file explorer.
### Server
To run as server, run this command in the terminal. Or make a shell script to run the server easily later on.
```
java -jar chat.jar servermode
```
You'll need to configure the server before running it. A configuration file will be made once you run the command for the first time and you need to configure it before running the server. The configuration file is located at your/jar/directory/appdata/config.json. The configuration file looks like this
```
insert config file here
```
It's worth noting not to modify any file inside the appdata folder except config.json as it could cause some problems.
